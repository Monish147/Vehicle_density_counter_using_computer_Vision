# Vehicle_density_counter_using_computer_Vision

we have used yoloV8s model for object detection to detect all types of vehicles . 
Coco.txt contains the objects that yolov8s model can detect.

we mainly classify the vehicles to 3 types : Car , Trucks , Motor Bikes and output the vehicle count of each in realtime.

You can directly run the main.py file and change the video path in the same file.
